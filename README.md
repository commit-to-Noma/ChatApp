# 💬 ChatApp – Java GUI Messaging System

🧠 I built this ChatApp as my first full Java project, completed between March and June 2025. It took me approximately 40 hours of learning, building, debugging, and perfecting it — and proudly earned a distinction for my final grade.

## 👩‍💻 About the Project

ChatApp is a desktop Java application that simulates message sending, storing, and searching in a graphical user interface. It helped me master Java fundamentals like classes, methods, arrays, and file I/O — while also exploring GUI development and practical app design.

Built entirely using Java Swing and FlatLaf, it stores messages locally in a structured JSON-like file, mimicking how real-world messaging systems manage data.
